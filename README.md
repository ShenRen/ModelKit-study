a infill program which can read a slc format file and transform it to discrete coordinate. And the generated coordinate can be use in the 3D printing machine.
I use the Qt 5.5.0(msvc2013) and Microsoft Visual C++ compiler 12.0(X86) compiler the program. 
Now, I forbid the CGAL model which is compilered by the msve2013, so you can compiler it with Qt 5.5.1(MinGW 32bit).
